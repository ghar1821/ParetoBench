# ParetoBench
A framework for benchmarking clustering algorithms, using Pareto fronts to capture tradeoffs in clustering performance as quantified through complementary use of several supervised clustering performance metrics. 

This repository is related to the following manuscript, which has been accepted to Bioinformatics journal. If you use ParetoBench in your work, please kindly cite our publication:

## Installation
Make sure you have Python >= 3.6 installed.
Then run the setup.py: `python3 setup.py install`

This shall install ParetoBench and all its dependencies.

It is mandatory to run Pandas >= 1.1.4 version.
The time of writing this README, 1.1.4 is only available from Pip. 
Thus please install from pip by running `pip install pandas==1.1.4`
